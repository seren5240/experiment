You must perform two tasks: first, you should break down the translation into the smallest logical components, whether that is a word, phrase or a full sentence, that can be matched from one language to the other. Return the breakdown in the form of a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the original text and the translated text. Second, you should identify any challenges, difficulties or quirks that are relevant in translating between the two given languages in the two snippets.
